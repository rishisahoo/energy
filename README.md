# Vision Statement

The vision document for our project aims to build an exceptional model for HVAC energy efficiency analysis, using data driven insights for better decision making in energy optimization. By using advanced statistical techniques and coding structures, we ensure both precision and accessibility for users. With the help of Github and consistent research we were able to successfuly create this tool.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Database Description The dataset consists of eight features and one target variable (X1), representing energy efficiency and system conditions. Key columns include: X1: Energy efficiency (target variable). X2-X4: Energy input and related metrics. X5-X8: Operational settings, HVAC modes, tolerances, and scenarios. 

# Roles

  Rishi Sahoo - Project Manager and UI/UX Designer: Worked on the User Interface and building the data models to ensure the project satisfies its goals.
  Cade Kolanowski - Product Manager and Release Manager: Built a schedule, and helped in development of the tool
  Michael Stephens - Lead Quality Assurance Analyst: Helped ensure the tool was error free
