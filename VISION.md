Vision Statement:
Our project aims to build a robust and user-friendly model for HVAC energy efficiency analysis, leveraging data-driven insights for better decision-making in energy optimization. 
By employing advanced statistical techniques and intuitive coding structures, we ensure both precision and accessibility for users. 
Rishi, as the Project Owner, spearheaded the development alongside Cade, who contributed extensively to coding and implementation. 
Michael played a critical role in ensuring code quality by identifying and addressing errors throughout the project.





Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Database Description
The dataset consists of eight features and one target variable (X1), representing energy efficiency and system conditions. Key columns include:

X1: Energy efficiency (target variable).
X2-X4: Energy input and related metrics.
X5-X8: Operational settings, HVAC modes, tolerances, and scenarios.
